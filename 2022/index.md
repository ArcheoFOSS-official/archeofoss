We would like to thank all those who submitted their abstracts by the deadline of 15th June. However, many of you wrote to us that due to academic/work schedules you needed some extra time in order to submit a paper. In agreement with the Scientific Committee and the Organising Committee we have therefore decided to postpone the deadline for the call for papers for ArcheoFOSS XVI 2022 to **30th June 2022**.

We look forward to your submissions!
